# Road-and-Building-images-in-segmentation
A deep learning project that segments roads and buildings in satellite images using a custom CNN. Trained on the OpenEarthMap Kaggle dataset, the model performs pixel-level segmentation of land cover features for urban and rural mapping. Preprocessed satellite images are used for accurate multi-class segmentation.
